## Collaboration Guidelines

-   **Naming Conventions:** Use clear, consistent names (e.g., `data_raw_1.csv`, not `data1.csv`). This improves discoverability and avoids confusion.
-   **Branches & Commits:**
    -   Create a new branch before making changes.
    -   Write meaningful commit messages (e.g., `"Added processed survey dataset"`).
    -   Use pull requests for review before merging into the main branch.
-   **Roles in Collaboration:**
    -   One member acts as **reviewer** (maintains the main branch).
    -   Other members act as **developers** (work on branches, submit pull requests).
-   **Merge Conflicts:** If two developers edit the same section, the reviewer will resolve conflicts by selecting or editing changes before merging.
